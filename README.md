<p align="right">(Semester-3 project)</p>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>
In an era where technology is increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the demand for innovative and accessible tools continues to grow. The Voice Scientific Calculator is a cutting-edge project designed to revolutionize how we interact with computational devices. By combining the functionalities of a traditional scientific calculator with advanced voice recognition technology, this project aims to provide an efficient, hands-free, and user-friendly solution for performing complex mathematical calculations.</p><p>
In this project me and my friends created a calulator GUI which can be operated on voice commands. which can work in offline 
modes for the better functing of the calculator.</p>                                                                             
we tried to make calulation easy and interesting one for the younger generation <br>
